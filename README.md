## üí° Tips & Tricks

- **MiniMessage Format**: When renaming items or adding lore, you can use MiniMessage format for rich formatting. Try `<gradient:#AA00FF:#DD55FF>My Cool Sword</gradient>` for a beautiful gradient effect!
- **Quick Navigation**: Use the pagination buttons to quickly browse through all available enchantments.
- **Permission Setup**: Consider using a permissions plugin to create permission groups for different player ranks.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Plugin commands aren't working.  
**Solution**: Ensure the user has the proper permissions and that the plugin is properly installed.

**Issue**: GUI doesn't open when using `/edit`.  
**Solution**: Make sure you're holding an item in your main hand that isn't blacklisted.

**Issue**: Enchantments aren't showing up.  
**Solution**: Check that the item type can be enchanted and that the user has the necessary permissions.
